TODO:
    - handle line-wrapping mode
    - configurable cursor for normal and scrolling
    - disconnect all signals on main scintilla in mini scintilla desctructor
      to avoid callbacks into plugin after unloading (or use plugin_signal_connect)
    - apply `geanyscihunting.patch` to Geany, it's needed to support putting
      the overview scintilla on the left.
